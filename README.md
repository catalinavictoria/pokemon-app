# Pokémon React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About the Project

This game was built as the final project for my Web Application Development class.

In this game, the user is presented with a Pokémon image and two buttons with different names on them, and the user has to make their best guess to correctly match the Pokémon image with the game. It also shows counters for correct and incorrect guesses and a timer.

For rendering the images, I used the [PokeRes API](https://pokeres.bastionbot.org/images/pokemon/1.png) and for the names I used the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).

## Motivation

Getting more familiar with making GET requests to an API and how to successfully show and use the information retreieved from it on the app's client-side. Besides that, I wanted to have more experience building single-page React applications without using an online development environment.

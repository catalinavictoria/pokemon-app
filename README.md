# Pokémon React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About the Project

This game was built as the final project for my Web Application Development class.

In this game, the user is presented with a Pokémon image and two buttons with different names on them, and the user has to make their best guess to correctly match the Pokémon image with the game. It also shows counters for correct and incorrect guesses and a timer.

For rendering the images, I used the [PokeRes API](https://pokeres.bastionbot.org/images/pokemon/1.png) and for the names I used the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).

## Motivation

Getting more familiar with making GET requests to an API and how to successfully show and use the information retreieved from it on the app's client-side. Besides that, I wanted to have more experience building single-page React applications without using an online development environment.

## Build Status

The main features of the game are already finished.

I'll be working on adding the following characteristics in the near future:
* Stop counter once the user clicks the 'Finish game' button.
* Show stats of the game in alert displayed when the user clicks 'Finish game'.
* Make GET resquests to the PokéAPI to get descriptions of the Pokémon that the user guesses correctly and show them alongside the correct message.
